TDD Phase 3 Complete: Search Term URL Encoding

The route_utils.dart implementation already uses Uri.encodeComponent() and Uri.decodeComponent() correctly, so all edge case tests passed immediately:

✅ ALL 27 tests passing (17 new Phase 3 tests)
✅ Spaces, hash symbols, slashes, emojis all encode/decode correctly
✅ Round-trip consistency verified for all edge cases
✅ No implementation changes needed

This validates that the existing URL encoding is production-ready for search terms with special characters.
