## Project Notes

Fixed compilation errors and cleaned up unused code after Divine Team changes:

**Issue**: After changing "Editor's Picks" to "Divine Team", there were compilation errors in settings_screen.dart claiming methods `showRemoveKeysWarningDialog` and `showDeleteAllContentWarningDialog` weren't defined.

**Root Cause**: Stale build cache. The methods were properly defined and imported, but Flutter's build system had stale artifacts.

**Solution**: 
1. Ran `flutter clean` to clear build cache
2. Ran `flutter pub get` to restore dependencies
3. Errors disappeared - methods were always properly imported

**Additional Cleanup**:
- Removed unused `dart:math` import from curation_service.dart
- Deleted unused `_fetchMissingEditorsPicksVideos()` method (150+ lines) - this was the old curation list implementation replaced by the new Divine Team direct author fetching
- Deleted unused `_matchesCoordinate()` method - only used by the deleted method
- Removed unused `_editorPicksCurationList` field - no longer needed for direct author fetching

**Final State**: 
- All compilation errors resolved
- All warnings in changed files resolved
- Code is cleaner and more maintainable
- Divine Team feature fully functional
