## Project Notes

Changed "Editor's Picks" to "Divine Team" in OpenVine:

1. **UI Changes (explore_screen.dart)**:
   - Changed tab label from "Editor's Pick" to "Divine Team"
   - Updated all references in comments and strings

2. **Constants (app_constants.dart)**:
   - Added two Divine Team member pubkeys:
     - divineTeamPubkey1: npub199wma3u7u7z5jmms8jty3ujxvew5dquur404stqrg269s0d9ej6qzewzu3
       (hex: 295dbec79ee785496f703c9648f246665d46839c1d5f582c0342b4583da5ccb4)
     - divineTeamPubkey2: npub1m9d23lqwl78y3z2jf9dcqeyer5nlh9hdsef0ztx7m3dyaz66u4qq4stysk
       (hex: d95aa8fc0eff8e488952495b8064991d27fb96ed8652f12cdedc5a4e8b5ae540)
   - Added divineTeamPubkeys list

3. **Service Logic (curation_service.dart)**:
   - Replaced `_fetchEditorsPicksListFromRelay()` with `_fetchDivineTeamVideos()`
   - Changed approach: instead of fetching a specific curation event (kind 30005), now fetches all videos (kind 34236) from the two Divine Team pubkeys
   - Videos are stored in `_editorPicksVideoCache` (kept legacy name for compatibility)
   - Videos are sorted by creation time (newest first)

**Architecture Change**: 
- Old: Fetch a curated list event, then fetch the videos referenced in that list
- New: Directly fetch all videos from specific authors (Divine Team members)

**No Breaking Changes**: 
- Kept existing variable names internally for compatibility
- All tests remain unchanged (though some were already failing for unrelated reasons)
