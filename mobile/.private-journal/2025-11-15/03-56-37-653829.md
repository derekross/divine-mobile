## Project Notes

Fixed Popular Videos tab to show only classic imported Vines by adding client-side filter using VideoEvent.isOriginalVine property. The filter happens in explore_screen.dart line 897 where we filter allVideos.where((v) => v.isOriginalVine) before sorting and displaying. This ensures new user-uploaded videos (which have originalLoops=null) don't appear in the Popular Videos tab. The isOriginalVine getter returns true when originalLoops != null && originalLoops > 0, which only applies to imported classic Vine content.
