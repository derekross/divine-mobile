## Project Notes

Found "Popular Videos" tab issue - it's designed to show imported classic Vine content sorted by originalLoops (loop count from classic Vine), but new user-uploaded videos don't have this metadata (they have originalLoops=null which defaults to 0). The videoEventsProvider requests sorting by loopCount from relay, but either: (1) relay doesn't support this sort, or (2) it's returning newest videos instead. The client-side sorting code correctly sorts by originalLoops descending, but all new videos tie at 0 loops, so they appear in whatever order the relay sends them (likely newest first). This is working as designed for classic Vine content, but doesn't handle new user content well.
