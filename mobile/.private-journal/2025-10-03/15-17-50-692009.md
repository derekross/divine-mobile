## Project Notes

Fixed profile screen tab switching crash caused by mixing sliver and box layout protocols. The "Liked" and "Reposts" tabs were trying to render sliver widgets directly in TabBarView, which expects box widgets.

This crash would occur when users navigated to the profile screen and tried to switch to the "Liked" or "Reposts" tabs.
