## Project Notes

Video publishing bug has TWO root causes:
1. Race condition - tries to publish before upload populates videoId/cdnUrl
2. Wrong CDN URL domain - using worker URL instead of cdn.divine.video

The upload IS working (gets Stream uploadURL) so endpoint exists somewhere, just returns wrong URL format.
