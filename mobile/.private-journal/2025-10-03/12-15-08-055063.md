## Project Notes

Crash fix deployed for thumbnail loading 404 errors. The crash was happening at startup when videos with missing thumbnails (404 URLs like https://cdn.divine.video/.../thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg) were being loaded.

Next time I see image loading issues on real devices but not in tests, remember that widget tests use mocked networking that behaves differently from real HTTP clients. Always test image loading on actual devices or simulators.
