## Project Notes

**OpenVine Video Publish Button Fixed**

The publish button was a fake - just a 2-second delay pretending to upload. Actual upload system existed all along via:
- UploadManager (Blossom uploads) 
- VideoEventPublisher (Nostr events)

Wired them together in video_metadata_screen_pure.dart using Riverpod providers. Now actually uploads to Blossom and publishes to relay.

Lesson: The codebase is complex - always research existing infrastructure before building new stuff.
