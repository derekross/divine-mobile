## Project Notes

## Notification Service Duplication Research

Found TWO separate notification service implementations:

1. **NotificationServiceEnhanced** (notification_service_enhanced.dart)
   - Purpose: Nostr social notifications (likes, comments, follows, mentions, reposts)
   - 614 lines, complex
   - Integrates with NostrService, UserProfileService, VideoEventService
   - Has Hive persistence for notifications
   - Uses NotificationModel (rich model with navigation actions)
   - Has comprehensive event subscriptions and filtering
   - Platform notifications: SIMULATED (lines 518-530, 533-548)

2. **NotificationService** (notification_service.dart)
   - Purpose: Upload/publishing status notifications
   - 296 lines, simpler
   - Has AppNotification model (different from NotificationModel!)
   - Handles: uploadComplete, videoPublished, uploadFailed, processingStarted
   - Platform notifications: SIMULATED (lines 228-240, 243-262)

**Current Usage**:
- Only NotificationServiceEnhanced is imported in app_providers.dart (line 28)
- Only NotificationServiceEnhanced is used in deferred_notification_initializer.dart
- Only NotificationServiceEnhanced has tests (notifications_navigation_test.dart)
- NotificationService appears to be ORPHANED - no active usage found!

**Key Issue**: Both have placeholder platform notification implementations but serve different purposes. This isn't crazy duplication - they're for different notification domains. BUT:
- They both use same infrastructure (permissions, platform notifications)
- Both could share a common platform notification layer
- NotificationService might be unused legacy code

Need to verify NotificationService usage before deciding on consolidation approach.
