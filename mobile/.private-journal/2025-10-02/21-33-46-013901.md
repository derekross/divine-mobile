## Project Notes

## NotificationService Cleanup Complete

Successfully removed the orphaned NotificationService:
- Deleted `/lib/services/notification_service.dart` (296 lines)
- No tests existed for it (glob search found none)
- No references found in codebase (grep confirmed only NotificationServiceEnhanced remains)
- flutter analyze shows NO errors related to notification_service.dart removal

All existing errors in flutter analyze output are pre-existing issues unrelated to this cleanup:
- Example service test issues
- Integration test issues with VideoEvent.forTesting
- Provider override signature issues
- Unused imports/elements

The codebase now has a single, unified notification service (NotificationServiceEnhanced) handling all Nostr social notifications. Upload status notifications were never implemented, so nothing was lost.

Next steps if needed: Implement actual platform notifications in NotificationServiceEnhanced (currently just placeholders using flutter_local_notifications).
