## Project Notes

Square video recording implementation completed for OpenVine:

- Videos now record and export as 1:1 square format (Vine-style)
- Camera preview shows square framing during recording
- Works for both single segments and multi-segment concatenation
- All video processing handled via FFmpeg during finalization
- No changes needed to camera capture resolution - cropping happens post-capture

Key files modified:
- `lib/services/vine_recording_controller.dart` - FFmpeg cropping logic
- `lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart` - Square preview UI
