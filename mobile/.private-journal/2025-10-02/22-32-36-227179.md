## Project Notes

Fixed ghost video playback completely by removing all eager active video setting from VideoPageView.initState(). The visibility detection system in VideoFeedItem is the single source of truth for video activation. This fixes both app-resume and camera-navigation cases.

Key insight: initState can't know if widget is actually visible (IndexedStack keeps widgets alive but hidden). Only visibility detection knows the truth.
