## Project Notes

## OpenVine Profile Loading Fix - Complete

Successfully migrated profile loading from imperative batch/cache architecture to reactive streaming architecture using Riverpod 3.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/providers/user_profile_providers.dart` - Complete rewrite as streaming providers
- `lib/screens/profile_screen_scrollable.dart` - Updated to use streaming providers
- `docs/AI_RULES_FLUTTER.md` - Documented Riverpod 3 as project standard

**Key Insight**: The codebase had two different patterns:
1. VideoEventService: Reactive (ChangeNotifier + notifyListeners) ✅
2. UserProfileService: Imperative (batch + wait + cache) ❌

Fixed by making profiles fully reactive using Riverpod Stream providers.

**Next Steps**:
- Test on macOS build (preferred per CLAUDE.md)
- Measure profile load timing with new architecture
- Consider removing UserProfileService class entirely (providers replaced it)
- Add performance logging to measure improvement
