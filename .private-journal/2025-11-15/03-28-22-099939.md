## Project Notes

## Settings Consolidation Task

Rabble wants to consolidate edit profile, relays, media servers, and notifications into a unified settings screen.

### Current Structure
The app currently has:
1. **SettingsScreen** (main hub) - already consolidated with sections for Profile, Account, Network, Preferences, and Support
2. **ProfileSetupScreen** - used for both new user setup AND editing existing profiles (isNewUser parameter)
3. **RelaySettingsScreen** - manage Nostr relay connections
4. **NotificationSettingsScreen** - notification preferences
5. **BlossomSettingsScreen** - media server configuration

### Analysis
Looking at the existing SettingsScreen, it's ALREADY well-organized with:
- Profile section with "Edit Profile" tile → navigates to ProfileSetupScreen
- Network section with "Relays" and "Media Servers" tiles
- Preferences section with "Notifications" tile

**The structure is already consolidated!** The main settings screen serves as a hub that navigates to specialized screens.

### Potential Interpretations of Request
1. **Inline all settings** - Put all settings controls directly in one long scrollable screen (not ideal UX)
2. **Tabs/Sections** - Group settings into collapsible sections or tabs
3. **Already done** - The current structure IS consolidated (just needs confirmation)

### My Recommendation
I think Rabble might want to see ALL settings inline in one screen rather than having separate navigation. But I need to ask first because:
- Current structure follows mobile UX best practices (hub-and-spoke navigation)
- Inline would create a very long screen
- Some screens like ProfileSetup have complex state (image upload, NIP-05 validation)
