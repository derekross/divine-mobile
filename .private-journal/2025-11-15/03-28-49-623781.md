## Project Notes

## Tabbed Settings Design

### Structure
Using DefaultTabController with 3 tabs:
1. **Profile Tab** - Edit profile inline (name, bio, avatar upload, NIP-05)
2. **Network Tab** - Relays list + Media servers config inline
3. **Notifications Tab** - All notification preferences inline

### Key Decisions
- Keep Account section (Logout, Remove Keys, Delete Content) in main settings before tabs
- Keep Support section (ProofMode, Bug Report, Save Logs) in main settings after tabs
- Profile tab will have inline form fields for editing (no separate screen)
- Network tab will combine relay list management + blossom server config
- Notifications tab shows all notification toggles and actions inline

### Tab Content
**Profile Tab:**
- Avatar upload/display
- Display name text field
- Bio text area
- NIP-05 username field with validation
- Key Management button (navigates to separate screen - too complex to inline)
- Save Profile button

**Network Tab:**
- Relays section with add/remove controls
- Blossom server toggle and URL field
- Relay diagnostics button (can still navigate out)

**Notifications Tab:**
- All notification type toggles (likes, comments, follows, mentions, reposts, system)
- Push notification settings
- Actions (mark all read, clear old)

This keeps the main settings flow on one screen with tabs while still allowing navigation to complex workflows like Key Management and Relay Diagnostics.
