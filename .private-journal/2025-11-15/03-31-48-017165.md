## Project Notes

## TDD RED Phase Complete

All tests are failing as expected! The existing SettingsScreen doesn't have tabs, so all the tab-related assertions fail.

**Failing tests:**
- TabBar not found
- Tab switching not working
- Profile tab content not inline
- Network tab content not inline  
- Notifications tab content not inline

Now proceeding to GREEN phase - implementing the tabbed settings screen.
