## Project Notes

**Lists Tab - Final Implementation Summary**

Successfully implemented complete Lists tab functionality:

**1. Lists Tab (Explore Screen)**
- Shows both People Lists (kind 30000) and Video Lists (kind 30005)
- Dark-themed card layout
- Pull-to-refresh
- Navigation to detail screens

**2. User List Detail Screen (People Lists)**
- **Top**: Horizontal carousel of profile avatars (tap → profile page)
- **Bottom**: Video grid showing all videos from list members
- Tap video → fullscreen player with back button
- Clean, Instagram-style layout

**3. Curated List Detail Screen (Video Playlists)**
- Video grid from the playlist
- Respects list playOrder settings (chronological/reverse/manual/shuffle)
- Tap video → fullscreen player with back button

**4. Providers**
- `userListsProvider` - All user lists
- `curatedListsProvider` - All curated lists  
- `allListsProvider` - Combined
- `curatedListVideos` - Videos in a playlist
- `userListMemberVideos` - Stream of videos from list members (filtered from discovery feed)

**User Request**: "Keep the explore tabs" - The Divine Team list screen shown in screenshot still shows "Explore" header with tabs. Need to ensure tabs remain visible when viewing lists.

**Current Status**: All navigation works, carousel + grid layout implemented. Ready to test in app.
