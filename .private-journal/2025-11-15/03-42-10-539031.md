## Project Notes

## Pivot: No Tabs, Just Better Organization

Rabble clarified: Don't use tabs, just improve the organization of the existing settings screen.

**New approach:**
- Keep the hub-and-spoke navigation model (it's actually good UX)
- Improve visual grouping and hierarchy
- Better section headers and descriptions
- Maybe consolidate some very simple settings inline (like notification toggles)
- Keep complex workflows as separate screens (Profile editing, Relays, etc.)

This is much simpler and doesn't require rewriting everything!
